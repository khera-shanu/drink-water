# drink-water
A small script to remind me for drinking water every hour.

## How to run

- `Python3 -m venv venv`
- `source venv/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python reminder.py`


## Possible improvements

- Play only when user is active on system.
- Integrate with google calendar to reduce disturbance.
- Run the script as a daemon/service in your OS.
  - If don't want to run as daemon run in BG with `nohup`!
- May be take input of drank quantity from user?
  - Daily/Weekly analytics report on same?
